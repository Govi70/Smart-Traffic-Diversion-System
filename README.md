# üö¶ Smart Traffic Diversion System (IoT Project)

This project is about developing a **Smart Traffic Diversion System (STDS)** using IoT to reduce urban traffic congestion.  
The system monitors traffic in real-time using sensors, processes the data, and dynamically diverts vehicles to less congested routes. It also integrates with the Blynk IoT platform for visualization and remote monitoring.

## üìå Project Objective
The main objective is to **optimize traffic flow** and **reduce congestion** by:
- Collecting real-time traffic data through sensors.
- Analyzing congestion and predicting traffic flow.
- Dynamically controlling traffic lights and diversions.
- Providing real-time updates to users via IoT platforms.
- Enhancing road safety and reducing fuel consumption.

## üìç Scope
- IoT-based sensors for real-time data collection.
- Traffic diversion algorithms for congestion management.
- Integration with Blynk IoT platform for monitoring and control.
- User interface to visualize traffic status.
- Scalable design for use in urban traffic systems.
